# ezclassify-rest-client

HTTP client for the EzClassify REST API. Delegates all operations over HTTP using
[httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/). No local JS runtime or Node.js required.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ezclassify-rest-client
```

## Usage

```python
from ezclassify_rest_client import EzClassifyClient

with EzClassifyClient("http://localhost:3000") as deployment:
    print(deployment.list_contexts())
    with deployment.context("my-context") as ctx:
        reading = ctx.scheme.validate("LEVEL-A//CTRL-X").result
        print(reading.rendered, reading.valid, reading.input_was_valid)
        for notice in reading.notices:
            print(notice.text, notice.required)
```

Omit the version to let the server choose: the context token's default, or
the newest published. `"latest"` asks for the same thing by name, and a
concrete version such as `"1.0.0"` pins the handle to it.

`validate` is the reader's call: it takes a marking as text or as the facts a
document states and answers whether it stands. `process` is the author's call:
it settles typed text with the facts already chosen and adds corrections,
proven fix paths, the outputs named in `outputs` and the picker options named
in `suggest_for`. `explain` returns the step-by-step trace of a process call.

Every result that describes a marking carries its `notices`, so reading them
costs no second call; the list is empty when the marking carries none.
`ctx.scheme.notices(...)` stays for assertions you assembled yourself and never
put through validate, process or aggregate.

Operations that read a marking take `input_format`, `output_format`, `surface`
and `context` as keyword arguments, named after the wire fields and accepted
only where the operation's request declares them. For a scheme that declares
surfaces, `output_format` and `input_format` also take a view id, a
`surface/view` address, or the id of one of a view's forms. `render` and
`apply_preset` take `output_format` alone.

`EzClassifyClient` represents a deployment. It provides health, Context
discovery, and Context binding. Classification never targets a loose scheme.

`suggest` takes partial text or `assertions` containing stated facts, exactly
one input. Empty text and an empty fact list are valid inputs. `input_format`
only accompanies text, on both `suggest` and `validate`; fact inputs accept
`output_format` and `surface` without a text format.

```python
options = ctx.scheme.suggest(assertions=[], surface="classification").result
```

Assertion `source` is an open string. The SDK forwards custom labels, values,
metadata and provenance without assigning meaning to them. Core processing
recognizes `infer`, `default`, `context`, and `repair` with `source_rule` as
previously derived facts; other labels, including `parse`, `user` and `stated`,
remain authored input. The engine owns settling and derivation.

## Errors and rate limits

Failures raise `EzClassifyClientError`, which carries `status_code`, the
server's stable `code` and `detail`, and the parsed error body in `payload`.
The server refuses a query parameter or body field an operation does not
declare with a `400` and code `INVALID_INPUT`, and this client sends only what
each operation declares.

A success the contract does not allow raises `MalformedResponseError`, a
subclass of `EzClassifyClientError`: a body that is not JSON, is the wrong
shape, or where a member the contract requires is missing at any depth, or
null where the contract does not allow null. Its `path` says where, in JSONPath, such
as `$.result.errors[0].code`. That points at the server or something in
between, such as a proxy. A `ValueError` is only ever about your own
arguments.

`timeout` (30 seconds by default) bounds each call from start to finish: the
connection, the request, and the whole response body. A server that stalls or
sends its answer a byte at a time cannot hold a call longer. Running out raises
`RequestTimeoutError`, which is an `EzClassifyClientError` and a built-in
`TimeoutError`. A timeout that is not a positive, finite number of seconds,
`None` included, is refused when the client or Context handle is built. Host
name lookup is bounded by your system's resolver settings rather than the
timeout, and through an `https://` proxy to an `https://` server a trickled TLS
record can stretch one read past it. The client honors `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` as
httpx does.

Any operation can answer `429`. The exception then carries `retry_after`, the
wait in seconds the server asked for, read from the `Retry-After` header and
otherwise from the body's `retryAfter`. It is `None` on every other error. The
client never waits or retries on its own; sleep for as long as your application
allows and send the request again.

## Response caching

A Context handle is the only cache between your code and the server, and every
EzClassify client caches the same operations the same way. These are kept:
`process`, `validate`, `explain`, `normalize`, `render`, `diff`, `aggregate`,
`aggregate_assertions`, `apply_preset`, `suggest`, `suggest_for_categories`,
`scan`, `describe_concept`, and `access.rules`. Everything else reaches the
server on every call: the scheme resource reads (`summary`, `concepts`,
`categories`, `formats`, `grammar`, `scopes`, `label_presets`), the view,
filter, coverage and notice operations, every guide operation, and
`describe()`.

Every request member is part of the key, so `process` with different `outputs`
or `suggest_for`, or `validate` given text and given facts, are different
requests, while the same arguments in another keyword order are one. Concurrent
identical calls share one HTTP request. A failed request, and a 200 whose body
is missing a member the contract requires, is never kept; the next call asks
again. Each caller gets its own copy of a shared answer, so changing a result
you were handed cannot change what another caller, or a later cached read,
sees.

A concrete Context version is pinned: a published version is immutable, so its
answers are kept until the handle closes or `ctx.clear_cache()` is called, and
only the 500-entry LRU bound evicts them. An omitted version and `"latest"` are
unpinned. Their answers expire after five minutes, two for scans, and an hour
for concept descriptions and access rules. When a response names a new resolved Context version, the handle drops
what it held.

A handle serves one caller. When the server refuses that caller, with a 401 or
with the constant `{"error": "not_found"}` 404 a deployment running
authentication answers unauthenticated requests with, the handle drops every
answer it holds. A 404 about a missing resource leaves them in place. To act as
someone else, build a new handle.

Access checks make a server request every time by default so each decision is
recorded in the deployment's audit trail. Document audit and access assessment,
access requirements and crosswalk translation are never cached, whatever the
options. A caller that accepts missing server audit records may opt in to
caching of the two access checks, `access.check` and `access.check_by_marking`,
and only under a concrete Context version. The option is refused with a
`ValueError` on an omitted version or `"latest"`, because the policy behind
either can change under the handle:

```python
with deployment.context("my-context", "1.0.0", cache_access_decisions=True) as ctx:
    decision = ctx.access.check_by_marking("LEVEL-A", {"clearance": "LEVEL_A"})
```

Pass `disable_cache=True` when creating a handle to send every operation to the
server. `clear_cache()` discards stored operation results without disconnecting.
Calls are synchronous and cannot be canceled individually.

## Describing the Context

`ctx.describe()` reads what the bound Context resolves to right now, which is
the record to keep beside an access decision:

```python
description = ctx.describe()
print(description.version, description.scheme.resolved_version)
for crosswalk in description.crosswalks:
    print(crosswalk.id, crosswalk.version, crosswalk.resolved_version)
```

It reports the composed scheme with its `layers`, the `guides` in precedence
order, the `access` policy, the `crosswalks`, and every held scheme with the
selector that addresses it in `schemes`. Each component carries the version the
Context declares (`version`, possibly `"latest"`) and the concrete one that
answered (`resolved_version`). Each call makes one request. `scheme.scopes()`
returns typed `SchemeScope` entries, each with an `id` and a `label`.

## Access and guide operations

Use the bound `access`, `guide`, `scheme`, `document`, and `crosswalk` groups:

```python
from ezclassify_rest_client import connect_context

ctx = connect_context("http://localhost:3000", context_id="my-context")
decision = ctx.access.check_by_marking("LEVEL-A", {"clearance": "LEVEL_A"})
print(decision.result.granted)
```

## Dependencies

`httpx` and `httpcore`, plus the `ezclassify-rest-contract` package. pip
resolves the exact floors from the package metadata.
