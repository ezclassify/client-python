"""Context-bound client surface for the EzClassify REST API.

``connect_context`` returns an :class:`EzClassifyContext` bound to one named,
versioned Context. Every operation routes through
``/v1/ctx/{context_id}/{version}/*``. The path selects the composed bundle
(scheme + layers + guides + access policy), so request bodies carry payload only.

Example::

    from ezclassify_rest_client import connect_context

    ctx = connect_context("http://localhost:3000", context_id="my-ctx", context_version="1.0.0")
    result = ctx.scheme.validate("MARKING")
    print(ctx.resolved_version)  # concrete version the server resolved

        ``assertions`` to process the chosen facts alone.

        The result carries everything :meth:`validate` answers, settled the

        the corrections that turn the text into canonical text, in
        ``recognition["corrections"]``, what was read before repair, and the
        proposed fixes, each a whole marking the engine has proven. ``renders``
        holds a rendering for each output named in ``outputs`` and nothing
        else. ``suggestions_for`` is present only when ``suggest_for`` names
        categories. A caller that only reads a marking calls :meth:`validate`,

                format id, or for a scheme that declares surfaces a view id,
                a ``surface/view`` address, or the id of a form exactly one
                view names. It selects output only and never narrows what
                may be read. Omitted, the scheme's default format, or for a
                scheme that declares surfaces, each surface the result
                writes in its default view for the marking's role.
            surface: Optional validation surface, named with one of the
                scheme's scope ids. Omitted, the marking is evaluated as a
                whole.
            input_format: Optional format the input is written in. For a
                scheme that declares surfaces, a view id, a ``surface/view``
                address, or the id of one of a view's forms. Omitted,
                recognition works it out, and ``recognition["inputFormat"]``
                reports what the text was read as.
            assertions: Optional facts already chosen, settled together with
                what ``marking`` states.
            context: Optional processing context, forwarded verbatim to the
                engine. ``{"role": "part", "partOf": {"rendered": ...}}``
                marks the input as a portion of the given whole marking. A

                text, reported in ``recognition["role"]``, and a marking with
                no role is written as a whole.
            parts: Part markings the whole must cover. The whole is judged as
                covering them: a part it does not cover is an error, and so is
                a part that does not read as a marking. Every rank floor and
                every proposed fix is worked out against the whole and these

                formats, or any format the scheme reads. Empty or absent, the

            outputs: Outputs to write into ``renders``, each spelled exactly as

                declares surfaces, a format id otherwise. Omitted or empty,

                the settled facts, in ``suggestions_for``. Omitted, nothing is
