"""Tests for the 1.0 public-surface gate in ``scripts/check_api_surface.py``.

The gate is only as good as the members it can see. Every wire model decodes
through ``from_dict``, which is declared once per shape in the private
``_model_helpers`` module and inherited by the generated ``models.py``. A gate
that resolved private bases within a single module only would leave those
signatures outside the frozen contract, so changing or dropping one would pass
the check in silence. These tests read the surface the gate actually builds.
