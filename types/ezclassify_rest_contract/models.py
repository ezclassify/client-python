class CoverageReport(_WireModel):
    """Result of a coverage check. The engine is given a list of child markings and a
    single parent marking, aggregates the children in the scheme's format, then compares
    the parent with the children category by category.

    A parent can fail to cover its children in two ways, and each has its own field.
    `missing` is what the children need that the parent does not carry. `excess` is what
    the parent carries that the children do not account for. A caller tells "add this"
    from "remove this" by which field a concept is in, not by reading error text.

    How a category is judged comes from how the scheme rolls it up. A category that a
    rollup pipeline names is judged as a `pipeline` category, whatever rollup it
    declares. Every other category is judged by the rollup it declares.

    In a `union` category the parent must carry every value the children roll up to, and
    anything it lacks is missing. A value no child carries is allowed on the parent and
    is not excess.

    In an `intersection` category the parent may carry only values every child allows,
    and anything else it carries is excess. A shorter list, or none, is allowed and is
    not missing.

    In a `max`, `min` or `least_upper_bound` category the children roll up to one value,
    ordered by rank (`max`, `min`) or by the concept hierarchy (`least_upper_bound`).
    The parent must sit at or above that value for `max` and `least_upper_bound`, and at
    or below it for `min`. A parent anywhere else, including one the hierarchy does not
    order against that value, is reported once, under `missing`, and never under
    `excess`. The value reported is what the parent and children roll up to together.
    For `max` and `min` that is the children's own value. For `least_upper_bound` it is
    the bound the parent and children share, which can sit beyond the children's value,
    and it is the children's own value when the hierarchy gives them no common bound.

    In a `pipeline` category the parent covers when rolling it up with the children
    leaves it unchanged. This relies on the pipeline leaving a parent rolled up on its
    own unchanged, which the scheme author has to make true.

    The findings in `pipeline` categories are worked out for all the categories one
    pipeline names together. First they are narrowed to what the children roll up to on
    their own: a value the rollup of parent and children adds is missing only when the
    children's own rollup carries it, and a parent value that rollup drops is excess
    only when the children's own rollup does not carry it. The narrowed findings are
    then tested by acting on every finding of the report: the excess is taken out of the
    parent and the missing is put in, replacing what a single-value category held. They
    are reported only when that gives a parent that is valid under the scheme's rules
    and covers the children in every category, judged against the children's rollup.
    Otherwise, and whenever narrowing would leave nothing, the findings are not
    narrowed: every value the rollup of parent and children adds is missing, and every
    parent value it drops is excess, including one the children carry. Pipelines are
    decided one at a time, in the order the scheme lists them. Each is judged with the
    findings already decided for the pipelines before it and the full findings for those
    after it.

    In a `first` or `last` category the children roll up to one value and the rollup has
    no restrictive direction, so the parent must state that value. A parent that states
    a different one is reported once, under `missing`, as the value it should state, and
    never under `excess`. In such a category that holds several values, values the
    parent states beyond the picked one are not reported.

    In a `symmetric_difference`, `exclusive_or` or `complement` category the children
    roll up to a set and the rollup has no restrictive direction, so the parent must
    state exactly that set. Rolled-up values the parent does not state are missing.
    Values the parent states beyond that set are excess: stated, but not what the
    children roll up to. Neither side is more restrictive than the other here.

    In a category where the scheme has an `expand_group` rule, a parent that carries
    every member a group declares in that category states the group, and the group is
    not missing from it. This does not apply to a category whose rollup has no
    restrictive direction (`first`, `last`, `symmetric_difference`, `exclusive_or`,
    `complement`), where the parent must state what the children roll up to as it is.

    In a `union` or `pipeline` category the scheme marks as a hierarchy root, a parent
    value ranked at or above a needed value also covers it.

    With no non-empty children, a valid parent is covered and both lists are empty.

    `rendered` is the aggregate of the children rendered in the requested format; the UI
    can display it directly as the computed rollup without a separate aggregate()
    round-trip.
