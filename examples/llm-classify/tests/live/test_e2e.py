"""Opt-in end-to-end tests for the llm-classify CLI in licensed MCP mode.

These tests spawn the real @ezclassify/mcp server subprocess and run the
CLI against it, no mocked HTTP calls, no fake JSON-RPC responses. The caller
supplies an already licensed MCP runtime configured with the signed content
for the ``cedar-valley`` Context, the demo's default (override it with
EZCLASSIFY_CONTEXT_ID). The audit needs a scheme with a whole form and a part
form, which Cedar Valley has.

Requires: Node.js >= 22, @ezclassify/mcp built (dist/ present), Python 3.11+.
MCP_SERVER_PATH must explicitly select that runtime.
