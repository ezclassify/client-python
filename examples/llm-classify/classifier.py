"""Document classification workflow that mirrors the MCP tool-use sequence.

The classifier drives two EzClassify calls in sequence, the same calls an LLM
agent makes when using the ``@ezclassify/mcp`` MCP server:

    audit_document_markings → find the overall marking and every part marking
                              in the document, and judge each one
    aggregate_markings      → compute the overall marking the valid parts
                              require

The audit reads markings someone else wrote, so it judges them the way
validate does and also checks whether the authored overall marking covers the
parts. The aggregate then says what overall marking those parts require, which
the report sets beside the one the author wrote. The aggregate result carries
its collected notices, so the report reads them straight off it instead of
calling the notices operation afterwards.

Each step is printed to stdout so the caller can see the tool-call sequence
as it unfolds, making this a CLI-friendly demonstration of the MCP workflow.
